Notes on hierarchy yaml
* Tempting to make squadrons of vehicles, like 3 wasps, 5 mongeese, etc
* However i think i will ignore that until later on the MRB path
* 1 vehicle = 1 decision making unit is probably fine for the first draft of the simulation
* 40k is like this (during the game)
* Transport vehicles in 40k are more like 'templates' of squad-nodes: You pick the template and get 2 squad nodes: the infantry and the transport vehicle.
* 40k does have vehicle squadrons for cheap light vehicles
* But idk if i really _need_ mongoose squads to maintain squad coherency. They don't in the Halo games.
* I think hyphen-style is more readable, but i think camelCase everywhere might be more consistent
  * But will have to find a good way to write assaultRifleMA5B
  * assaultRifleHeavy? assaultRifleRuggedized?
* Maybe drop some hyphen bullets and just make those hashes. Can finalize that later.
* i guess the hierarchy maybe isnt exhaustive: components that are built-in to the template might be implied.
  * Example: A warthog might have a implied chaingun turret component.
* i could also do namespacing just by having long ids/names
  * halo-unsc-standard-small-arms-category
  * halo-oni-comms-marine
* See scifi-game-armygen for a randomTable stab at this same topic
  * I dont go into details of mixed squads tho.
  * Maybe i shouldnt for MRB. Wont affect gameplay much.
  * Same with dedicated transports, disembarkings
