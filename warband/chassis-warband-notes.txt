notes:
- i know omitting 40k's army list restrictions (troops, elites, fast attack) can lead to cheese (homogenous) warbands. 
- But if i do implement this clash of clans model that might mitigate it.
- ie you have to post a defense warband to a region and have it hold out (with ressurections between battles) against several unknown Attack Warbands. You can't anticipate your foes.
- Also i think the ability to field 6 Wasps is flavorful and sim-ish in a cool way.
- I am however tempted to put a maximum on the number of squads per 500 points, etc. I like the idea of being able to field a 3-person infiltration squad, but i dont want to see 99 marines in 33 squads, if that doesnt fit the story:
  - A alternate solution to that problem would be to make small squads impractical for numbers-tactics, ideally in whichever way they are impractical in story:
    - Maybe it weakens morale
    - Maybe it makes them too unwieldy to command quickly
    - Maybe there is some overhead per-squad

    - empty, S, SS, L, V, VS, VSS, VL
    - Alternately, disallow L and call that just 2 Ss.
    - Phantom can hold 0-1 vehicle (up to 2 ghosts) and 0-2 squads
  - wraiths:
    - various types (ultra, AA)
    - various crew (elites, brutes, grunt gunner)
  - 1 to 2 ghosts:
    - various types and drivers
  - spectre, prowler, revenant, chopper
  - locust i guess
  - lances (S or L):
    - leader can be elite, brute, grunt officer, jackal officer
  - heavy weapons grunts
  - ranger squad
  - jackal patrol:
    - leader can be jackal, elite, brute
  - hunter pair (S) plus something else
  - elite squad:
    - conventional, rangers, stealth, spec ops, command, zealot, honor guard, vip
  - brute squad:
    - can include chieftain
  - drone swarm (S or L)


yaml syntax wishlist:
- Shorthand for a commonly-repeated set of items in a hierarchy (like armories)
- Shorthand for variant templates and templates with common elements. Something like subclasses or inheritance.
- Syntax in hierarchies for slots. 'One of the following', 'n of the following', etc:
  - Maybe a field componentRequirements: 'slots'
- Syntax in hierarchies for homogenous individuals. Like a multi node with a flexible quantity:
  marineSquad:
    template: squadNode
    min: 3
    max: 20
    components:
      - marine:
          special: homogenous
      - officer:
          max: 1
      - specialWeaponMarine:
          max: 2
- Syntax for namespaces:
  - i would like to be able to call the squad node for a squad representing a warthog 'warthog' in the yaml.
  - i would also like to call the node for the individual 'warthog'
  - When it is ambigious, i would like to be able to say squads/warthog or individuals/warthog or something.
  - i would ideally like to just specify one tag or namespace, not all of them (halo/unsc/templates/individuals/warthog is inferior to halo/warthog if the halo category is the part that distinguishes it locally).
  - As a mrb short term solution, i could just make the names long, like warthogSquad...

Notes on hierarchy yaml
* Tempting to make squadrons of vehicles, like 3 wasps, 5 mongeese, etc
* However i think i will ignore that until later on the MRB path
* 1 vehicle = 1 decision making unit is probably fine for the first draft of the simulation
* 40k is like this (during the game)
* Transport vehicles in 40k are more like 'templates' of squad-nodes: You pick the template and get 2 squad nodes: the infantry and the transport vehicle.
* 40k does have vehicle squadrons for cheap light vehicles
* But idk if i really _need_ mongoose squads to maintain squad coherency. They don't in the Halo games.
* I think hyphen-style is more readable, but i think camelCase everywhere might be more consistent
  * But will have to find a good way to write assaultRifleMA5B
  * assaultRifleHeavy? assaultRifleRuggedized?
* Maybe drop some hyphen bullets and just make those hashes. Can finalize that later.
* i guess the hierarchy maybe isnt exhaustive: components that are built-in to the template might be implied.
  * Example: A warthog might have a implied chaingun turret component.
* i could also do namespacing just by having long ids/names
  * halo-unsc-standard-small-arms-category
  * halo-oni-comms-marine
* See scifi-game-armygen for a randomTable stab at this same topic
  * I dont go into details of mixed squads tho.
  * Maybe i shouldnt for MRB. Wont affect gameplay much.
  * Same with dedicated transports, disembarkings
